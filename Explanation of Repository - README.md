# Practice-Machine-Learning-Notebooks

Publically available datasets have been used to practice various machine learning techniques. 

A bit about myself: 
I am a medical doctor by profession with 5 years experience in clinical medicine. 
I completed a 1 year MSc Health Data Science at UCL. 
I am currently looking for an opportunity as a Data Scientist. 

Please note these are models I am practicing on and attempting to make improvements to my techniques. Thus code should be compared to other sources as errors may be present. 

In the first commit the following datasets were used: 
- Titanic (Dataset downloaded from: Kaggle)
- Cleveland Heart Disease (Dataset obtained from: UCI Repository)
- Wisconsin Breast Cancer (Dataset obtained from: UCI Repository)
- House Prices (Dataset downloaded from: Kaggle)
